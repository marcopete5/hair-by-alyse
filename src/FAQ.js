                            A trial is not necessary, but can help bring peace of mind for the bride. About half of my brides choose to do a trial. I would suggest doing a trial if you one of the following applies to you:
                            1-You have an idea of what you want, but you arenâ€™t sure how it will look on you.
                            2- You tend to be very picky with your hair and you want to make sure you will love the style for your wedding day.
                            3- You want to have your hair curled and down in some way and you want to see how well the curl will last on YOUR hair.

                        <td>No. I actually prefer working with hair when it isn't perfectly silky, soft and clean. BUT I don't like working with greasy hair either, so unless your hair gets oily really quickly, don't wash it the same day. If your hair doesn't get greasy for a few days, then you can come with it a few days "dirty" too.</td>

                        <td>If you plan to have your hair styled down in any way (anything except an updo) then yes... most of the time extensions will enhance any look and even help it last longer. If you are wanting an updo, it just depends, email me if you are unsure. When selecting extensions I recommend looking at Sally Beauty Supply and DON'T buy synthetic hair that requires the hair to cool completely before a curl will take.</td>

                        <td>YES! 99% of the time I place a floral crown on a bride, the florist makes them too small (even when they measure your head). Just go ahead and tell your florist you have a big head OR you would like your crown really large. Floral crowns look a lot better when they are made bigger! A floral crown that is made too small will never look quite right once it has been placed on your head. Also, tell your florist you want it SIMPLE. Once again, I'm always giving floral crowns a trim, because they have been made with way too much on them. SIMPLE AND BIG is the way to go. With all that being said, have it with you the day I do your hair, I still like to examine it, tweak it, fit it, and make sure it looks ideal on YOU.</td>
